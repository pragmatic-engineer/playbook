# Playbook

An opinionated toolkit for Claude Code. It gives you slash commands, skills and subagents for planning, building, reviewing and remembering, plus a small Rust binary that runs the safety guards, hooks, launcher and status line.

The skills ship as a Claude Code plugin and work on their own. The binary, which adds the guards, hooks, status line and launcher, is optional. Only want the usage dashboard? See [pbtop](docs/guides/11-pbtop.md).

## Install

Pick the first route that fits. Each one installs the `playbook` binary. Then run `playbook setup`.

1. **Homebrew** (macOS and Linux):

   ```bash
   brew install pragmatic-engineer/tap/playbook
   playbook setup
   ```

   Use the full name. It trusts only this formula. See [Homebrew tap trust](#homebrew-tap-trust).

2. **Install script**, when you have no Homebrew. It downloads the release binary, checks its SHA256 checksum, and its build attestation when `gh` can check it, puts it on `PATH`, and asks whether to run `playbook setup`:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pragmatic-engineer/playbook/main/install.sh | bash
   ```

3. **cargo binstall or mise**. Use `--git`, because a plain `cargo binstall playbook` installs a different project:

   ```bash
   cargo binstall --git https://github.com/pragmatic-engineer/playbook playbook
   mise use github:pragmatic-engineer/playbook
   ```

4. **.deb or .rpm** for Debian, Ubuntu and Fedora, from the [latest release](https://github.com/pragmatic-engineer/playbook/releases/latest). See [the install guide](docs/guides/00-install.md#debian-ubuntu-and-fedora-packages).

5. **Marketplace plugin**, for the skills only. It adds no binary, hooks or guards:

   ```bash
   claude plugin marketplace add pragmatic-engineer/marketplace
   claude plugin install playbook@pragmatic-engineer
   ```

For the best result, install the binary first and the plugin after it. Nix, Windows, a pinned version and a route with no `curl | bash` are in the [install guide](docs/guides/00-install.md). To see what `playbook setup` changes before you agree, read [What setup installs](docs/guides/05-what-setup-installs.md).

Update with `brew upgrade playbook` on Homebrew, or `playbook update` on the other routes. On a brew install, `playbook update` stops and tells you to run `brew upgrade playbook`. Run `playbook doctor check` to see what is in place, or `/playbook:doctor` in a Claude Code session.

### Homebrew tap trust

Since Homebrew 6.0.0, a tap that is not official needs your trust. Installing a fully qualified name trusts only that formula:

```bash
brew install pragmatic-engineer/tap/playbook
```

The install records that trust, so a later `brew upgrade playbook` works by short name. To install by short name without using the full name first, trust the formula:

```bash
brew tap pragmatic-engineer/tap
brew trust --formula pragmatic-engineer/tap/playbook
```

`pbtop` is a separate formula: `brew trust --formula pragmatic-engineer/tap/pbtop`. To trust every current and future formula in the tap, run `brew trust pragmatic-engineer/tap`. This is broader, so prefer per-formula trust. Run `brew trust` to list trusted entries, and `brew untrust <target>` to remove one. If Homebrew says a formula is not trusted, run the trust command it names. More in the [install guide](docs/guides/00-install.md#homebrew-tap-trust).

## A first session

```text
/playbook:plan          turn an idea into a verified plan
/playbook:implement     build it with subagents and TDD, one commit per work unit
/playbook:create-pull-request
/playbook:review        recommends a quick or a deep review, then runs the one you pick
```

For a small bug, `/playbook:fix` goes from a failing test to one pull request. For a big choice, `/playbook:adr` records the decision. The [guides](docs/guides/01-plan-and-implement.md) walk through each flow. The full list of commands is in the [slash command table](docs/reference/commands.md).
