# Session Start

Pick up where the last session in this directory stopped. `/playbook:session-handoff` saves a handoff, and when the session-start hook is installed it loads that handoff on its own after `/clear`. Run this command when no handoff appeared, or to read it again.

## Run this now

Run every step immediately and do not ask for confirmation.

1. Load the handoff without deleting it. Intent: handoff-show. If the session's tool map (printed at session start) lists it, use that command, with `--all` when `$ARGUMENTS` has it. A handoff the hook already loaded still prints, labelled "already loaded by the last session start". Otherwise do this:
   - Folder: `~/.config/playbook/repos/<owner>/<repo>/handoff/`, where `<owner>/<repo>` is `git remote get-url origin` with the scheme, any `user@`, the host and a trailing `.git` stripped. With no `origin` remote, use `~/.config/playbook/runtime/handoff/`.
   - Slug: `printf '%s' "$PWD" | tr -c 'A-Za-z0-9' '-'`.
   - Run `ls -t <folder> <folder>/used 2>/dev/null` (no shell glob, since zsh aborts on an unmatched glob), keep the names that start with `<slug>-`, and read the first file whose name after the slug is `-<epoch>-<pid>.md` (every such file with `--all`); a longer name belongs to a child or sibling directory. A file in `used/` was already loaded by a session start; say so. Skip a file older than 14 days.

2. If nothing was found, say `No handoff saved for this directory` in one line and stop. When the folder holds handoffs for other directories, name the one that looks closest and tell the user to `cd` into that directory and run this command again.

3. Orient in three to five lines: where we are, the decisions that still matter, and the next steps in order. Use only what the handoff says.

4. Check it against reality with `git branch --show-current` and `git status --short`. Compare the branch and the working tree with the handoff's "Where we are now". Name each difference in one line. Do not fix anything.

5. Finish with the first next step as the proposed action. Do not start it.
