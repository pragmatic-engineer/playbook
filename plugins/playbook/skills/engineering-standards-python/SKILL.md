# Engineering Standards: Python

Language-specific engineering standards for Python, derived from the team's base standards. RFC 2119 keywords (MUST, SHOULD) carry their standard meanings.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** engineering-standards owns the general rules (PR readiness, size, test types and requirements, the mocking philosophy, deployment). Read it first. This skill adds only the Python specifics and does not restate the base.

## How to use this skill

- The index below holds one line per rule. Each topic names a reference file in this skill's `references/` folder and says when to load it. Load only the files the work touches.
- When you review a diff that touches `.py` or `.pyi` files, load the reference for each topic the diff touches. Cite the rule and the Ruff rule, type checker flag or command that checks it.
- The project's own setup wins. When `pyproject.toml`, `ruff.toml`, the type checker config, CI or the contributing guide sets a rule, follow it over this skill.
- Set `lint.select` in the Ruff config and list each group or code you rely on. The default set depends on the version: up to Ruff 0.15 it is `E4`, `E7`, `E9` and `F`, and Ruff 0.16 grew it to about 400 rules. A rule the references mark (preview) also needs `preview = true`.
- Snippets target Python 3.12 and later unless a rule says otherwise.

## Rules index

### Style and naming

- Let the formatter own layout. Names follow PEP 8: `snake_case`, `CapWords`, `UPPER_CASE` constants, and a `_` prefix for internal names.
- Group imports (standard library, third party, local), import modules by absolute path, and no `import *`.
- Public modules, classes and functions have docstrings in one style per project.

Load `references/style-and-naming.md` when you name things, write imports, docstrings or comments, or review a diff for readability.

### Idioms

- Use comprehensions, generators, `enumerate`, `zip(strict=True)`, unpacking and f-strings over index loops and manual counters.
- Open every resource in a `with` block. Use `pathlib` for paths.
- Ask forgiveness for one narrow operation, and check first when the check is cheap and race free.

Load `references/idioms.md` when you write a loop, a comprehension, a `with` block, string formatting or path handling.

### Data modeling

- Model a record with a `dataclass` (frozen when you can), a closed set of values with an `Enum`, and an interface with a `Protocol`.
- Validate untrusted data at the boundary with Pydantic (or the project's validator), and pass plain typed objects inside.

Load `references/data-modeling.md` when you add a class that holds data, an enum, a protocol, or code that parses input into objects.

### Types and typing

- Annotate every public function. Run mypy or pyright in strict mode in CI.
- No `Any` across a boundary, `X | None` over `Optional[X]`, and a runtime check over `cast`.

Load `references/types-and-typing.md` when you add or change annotations, a generic, a `TypedDict`, a `cast`, a `# type: ignore`, or the type checker config.

### Error handling

- Catch the narrowest exception. No bare `except:`, and no `except` that passes in silence.
- Raise a custom exception from one project base class, and chain with `raise ... from err`.
- Log with `logger.exception` and lazy `%` arguments. No `print` in library or service code.

Load `references/error-handling.md` when you write `try`, `except`, `raise`, a custom exception, or a logging call.

### Functions and classes

- Small functions with one job. No mutable default arguments. Keyword-only parameters after the first one or two.
- Prefer composition over inheritance. A class has state and behavior. A module of functions replaces a class with only static methods.

Load `references/functions-and-classes.md` when you add a function, a class, a property, a dunder method or a decorator.

### Antipatterns

Load `references/antipatterns.md` when you review a Python diff. It is a checklist of the most common smells, each with a fix, and a check where one exists.
