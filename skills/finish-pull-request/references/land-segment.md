# Landing a Segment (`--boundary=land`)

Read by `/playbook:implement` Step 10, only when the run uses `--boundary=land`. The step headings and decision rows below keep the names `commands/implement.md` refers to.

## Contents

- Step 10: Land the Segment (promote, gate on CI, merge, confirm, fix tiers, park)
- Decision rows for `land`

## Step 10: Land the Segment

Runs once per Segment, immediately after Step 9 opened that Segment's PR, and MUST complete with the PR reading `MERGED` before Step 5 creates Segment N+1's branch. Skip this step entirely under **savepoint** and **pause**.

**The governing rule: attempt, then re-read state. Never conclude from an exit code.** `gh pr merge --auto` returns 0 when it merely *arms* auto-merge, and returns non-zero while still enqueueing successfully (this repo prints `! The merge strategy for main is set by the merge queue` to stderr and enqueues anyway). Both directions of the exit code lie. The exit code and stderr route the next probe; only a fresh `gh pr view` adjudicates. Equally, do NOT pre-compute whether a human review is required from `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}` (`allow_auto_merge`, `permissions.admin`) or from branch-protection/ruleset introspection: those are two different APIs a repo may use either of, and neither tells you whether *this* PR is already satisfied. `reviewDecision` on the PR does, because GitHub computes it across whichever system is active, including approvals already present.

**Never pass `--delete-branch`.** It is redundant where the repo sets `delete_branch_on_merge`, and it deletes the LOCAL branch even when the merge itself fails (seen during a 503), which is the one state this loop must not land in.

**1. Promote to ready.** `/playbook:create-pull-request` opens a draft unless `pr.draft` is `false`, and a draft cannot enqueue (`Pull request is a draft`). Promote it directly (a no-op when the PR already opened ready):

```bash
gh pr ready "$BRANCH"
```

**Do NOT invoke `playbook:finish-pull-request` (it runs `/clear`, then `/playbook:deep-review --self`), and do NOT pass `--ready` to `/playbook:create-pull-request`.** That step exists to guarantee a human is never the first reviewer of unreviewed code; Steps 8 and 9 above already satisfied that invariant for this Segment, more strongly, with a 5-lens swarm whose reviewers ran in fresh contexts that never saw the implementation. Its `/clear` is context isolation by hand for a session that wrote the code itself; subagent dispatch is context isolation by construction. And `/clear` cannot be issued programmatically at all, so instructing it inside an autonomous loop would mean stopping to ask the user to type it, once per Segment, which is exactly what `land` exists to remove. Record in the ledger which review satisfied the gate: `review: implement-step9 (5 lenses, <n> findings fixed)`.

**2. Gate on required checks.** Poll with a deadline; never `--watch` unbounded.

```bash
playbook pr ci-wait "$PR"
```

`--required` is deliberate: the merge gate is what the repo enforces, not every check that exists. A failing NON-required check does not block the merge, but MUST be reported as a follow-up rather than silently dropped. `CI_VERDICT=NONE` (the repo requires no checks) is a legitimate pass; record it as `NONE`, never as `PASS`, so the ledger does not claim a gate that never ran. `CI_VERDICT=TIMEOUT` parks the Segment; do not merge a PR whose checks never finished.

**3. CI-fix loop (two budgets, counted separately).** **3 fix attempts** per Segment, matching the existing `--auto: WU fails after 3 retries -> stop` rule, plus **2 reruns** per Segment. A rerun is not a fix and MUST NOT consume the fix budget.

**Transient, not a code failure** (rerun, don't fix) when either holds:
- `CI_VERDICT=CANCELLED`: `concurrency: cancel-in-progress` cancelled the run behind a newer push. `CANCELLED` is not `FAILURE`.
- The failed *step* is `Set up job`, which runs before any repo code, so the failure cannot be yours (typically a rate-limited action download taking the whole matrix red at once):

```bash
# Left as gh's own --jq: it runs gh's bundled Go jq implementation, not the
# system jq binary, so it is out of scope for this port.
gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/<id>/jobs" \
  --jq '.jobs[] | select(.conclusion=="failure")
        | "\(.name) -> \(.steps[] | select(.conclusion=="failure") | .name)"'
```

Either case: `gh run rerun <id> --failed`, then return to step 2. Max 2 reruns; a third consecutive transient parks the Segment as `CI_UNSTABLE` rather than burning turns.

**Genuine failure:** apply `playbook:systematic-debugging` to find the root cause before touching code, dispatch an `implementer` scoped to the failing check's diagnosis on the Segment branch, then `/playbook:commit-and-push`, then return to step 2. **A formatter failure MUST be fixed by running the project's own formatter** (`cargo fmt`, `prettier --write`, `ruff format`, per the Step 3 stack detection), never by hand-editing lines to satisfy it: a hand-edit burns a fix attempt and usually trips the next wrapping rule. Capture `<pre-fix-sha>` before the fix; step 4 needs it.

**4. Re-review the fix, tiered by what the fix actually is.** Re-running the full 5-lens swarm for a one-line format fix is waste; skipping review for a logic change is not. Classify the fix diff mechanically, do not judge:

- **Tier 0, no re-review.** The fix diff is empty (rerun only), or the fix is confined to CI workflow config that touches no shipped code, or the fix is provably tool-generated. Prove the last case, don't assert it: from the pre-fix tree, re-run the formatter/codegen and confirm it reproduces the fix exactly (`git diff --quiet` against the fix's tree). If the tool reproduces it, there is no human-authored change to review.
- **Tier 1, one scoped lens.** Touches production or test code, under 50 changed lines, and no file outside the Segment's `Files`. Dispatch ONE `reviewer-low` (`subagent_type: reviewer-low` when `playbook effort resolve agents reviewer --json` lists it in `allowed`, else `playbook:reviewer`, small diff per "Pick the tier" in `playbook:delegating-subagents`) with focus `correctness` (plus `tests` when the fix touched test files), scoped to `git diff <pre-fix-sha>..HEAD`, the fix diff only, never the whole Segment diff.
- **Tier 2, full Step 9 swarm scoped to this Segment.** Any one of: a file outside the Segment's `Files`; over 50 changed lines; a changed public signature, or a deleted or weakened assertion; the failing check was a security check (secret scanning, dependency/vulnerability scanning) rather than build/lint/test; **or this is the 2nd or 3rd fix attempt**. Repeated failure means the first root-cause diagnosis was wrong, which is exactly when a narrow re-look is worthless.

Record the tier and its finding count in the ledger. Fix Tier 1/2 findings per Step 9's rules, then return to step 2.

**5. Read the PR's real state before attempting anything.**

```bash
gh pr view "$PR" --json state,mergedAt,isDraft,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,reviewDecision,autoMergeRequest,baseRefName \
  -q '{state,mergedAt,isDraft,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,reviewDecision,autoMerge:(.autoMergeRequest!=null),base:.baseRefName}'
```

Route in this order, first match wins:

1. `state == "MERGED"` -> go to step 8.
2. `state == "CLOSED"` and `mergedAt == null` -> the PR was closed out from under this run. `mergeable`/`mergeStateStatus` will sit at `UNKNOWN` forever and look like GitHub computation lag; it is not. Under `land` no sibling PR is ever open, so this should be impossible: report it as an invariant violation and STOP. Do not auto-reopen.
3. `isDraft == true` -> step 1 did not take; re-run `gh pr ready` once, then re-read.
4. `mergeable == "CONFLICTING"` or `mergeStateStatus == "DIRTY"` -> **conflict, a different problem entirely.** This is not a permissions question and `--admin` cannot bypass it. `git fetch origin <default-branch>` and `git rebase origin/<default-branch>`, resolve, `git push` (chained with `&&`, never as a separate statement), return to step 2. If a conflict hunk falls in a file outside the Segment's `Files`, STOP and report: resolving it would silently rewrite work this Segment does not own. Max 2 conflict-resolution attempts, then park as `CONFLICT`.
5. `mergeable == "UNKNOWN"` -> GitHub is still computing. Re-read after 10s, up to 6 times. Route 2 already ruled out the closed-PR case that makes `UNKNOWN` permanent.
6. `mergeStateStatus == "BEHIND"` -> the base moved while CI ran. Rebase onto `origin/<default-branch>` and push; do not merge and do not park. Return to step 2.
7. `reviewDecision == "CHANGES_REQUESTED"` -> **park unconditionally** (step 7). A human looked and objected; that is categorically different from nobody having looked yet, and it MUST NOT be bypassed even where `--admin` would succeed.
8. Otherwise -> step 6.

**6. Attempt the merge, then re-read.**

```bash
playbook pr merge "$PR"
```

No strategy flag: where a merge queue is required it sets the strategy, and passing one only adds a stderr warning. If the output of `playbook pr merge` says auto-merge is not allowed for this repository, fall back to a synchronous `gh pr merge "$PR" --squash` (checks are already green by step 2); that is a repo-settings difference, not a permissions block, and it is discovered by attempting, not by reading `.allow_auto_merge` first.

Then poll to a terminal state, re-reading rather than believing `merge_rc`:

```bash
playbook pr land-wait "$PR"
```

`RESTATE` returns to step 5. `TIMEOUT` with everything green falls through to the admin escalation below; a merge queue can hold a PR for its full batching window, so a deadline shorter than that window would escalate needlessly.

**Admin escalation (MUST be gated on green checks).** Only when `LAND_VERDICT` is `REVIEW_GATE` or `TIMEOUT`, `mergeable == "MERGEABLE"`, AND step 2 returned `CI_VERDICT=PASS` or `NONE`:

```bash
playbook pr merge "$PR" --admin
```

**`--admin` bypasses required status checks, not only reviews.** Never reach it from a failing or unfinished CI state: the 3-attempt fix cap has no admin escape hatch, and "give up on CI, merge it anyway" is never a valid outcome of this loop. Re-read state afterwards, as always. If the output of `playbook pr merge --admin` says the PR must be merged using the asynchronous merge REST API, the PR's base is another open PR's branch, which `land` guarantees cannot happen: report the topology invariant as violated and STOP rather than retrying. Any permission refusal goes to step 7 with the message recorded verbatim.

**7. Park (a stop, not a wait).** A human approving and merging cannot happen inside one turn, so parking ends the run, the way **pause** does, but only because genuinely blocked. Record in the ledger:

```
land: PARKED
parked_reason: reviewDecision=REVIEW_REQUIRED; `gh pr merge --admin` refused: <verbatim message>
parked_at: <ISO-8601>
```

Then report and STOP: the PR URL and number; the verbatim blocking field and refusal message; what is already green (required checks passed, Step 9 self-review done, N findings fixed, ledger-confirmed); the remaining Segments by name; and the literal resume command. Do not open the remaining Segments' PRs, do not start their branches, and do not fall back to another boundary without asking.

**Resuming a parked Segment (MUST, and it differs from a normal ledger resume).** A normal resume continues *work*; a parked resume first checks whether the block cleared. Before any dispatch, any branch operation, or any re-review:

```bash
gh pr view "$PR" --json state,mergedAt,reviewDecision,mergeStateStatus \
  -q '[.state,(.mergedAt//"-"),(.reviewDecision//"-"),.mergeStateStatus]|@tsv'
```

- `MERGED` -> go to step 8 and continue to Segment N+1. Do not re-run Steps 7-9 for this Segment.
- `OPEN` with `reviewDecision == "APPROVED"` -> a human approved but did not merge. Re-enter at **step 5 only**. Do not re-review, do not re-push, do not re-run CI unless step 5 routes you there.
- `OPEN` with the block unchanged -> still parked. Report and stop again immediately, having run nothing. A resumed run MUST NOT redo work on a parked PR.
- `CLOSED` with `mergedAt == null` -> ask the user before anything else.

**8. Confirm the content actually landed, then advance (MUST).** A merge command's success message is not evidence, the same way a subagent's `DONE` is not (Verify-by-diff, Step 5):

```bash
git fetch origin "$DEFAULT_BRANCH"
git log --oneline -1 "origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH"
git diff "origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH" "$SEGMENT_BRANCH" -- <the Segment's Files>
```

That last diff MUST be empty. A squash-merge collapses the branch's internal shape, so the trees match even though the commits do not. A non-empty diff means either concurrent merges by someone else (re-check scoped to the Segment's own `Files`, which is why the pathspec is there) or content genuinely lost; investigate before continuing, never assume. Record `land: MERGED (<merge-sha>)` in the ledger, then return to Step 5 for Segment N+1, whose branch MUST be created off the `origin/<default-branch>` just fetched.

## Decision rows for `land`

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| `land`: Segment's PR just opened | `gh pr ready <branch>` directly; do NOT invoke `playbook:finish-pull-request` (`/clear` + `deep-review --self`) and do NOT pass `--ready`: Steps 8-9 already reviewed this diff, and `/clear` cannot be issued programmatically (Step 10) |
| `land`: required checks green (or none required) | Attempt `gh pr merge <n> --auto`; re-read `state`/`autoMergeRequest` before believing the exit code, in either direction (Step 10) |
| `land`: `mergeable: CONFLICTING` / `mergeStateStatus: DIRTY` | Conflict, not permissions: rebase on the fetched default branch, push `&&`-chained, re-run CI. Never `--admin`; it cannot bypass a conflict (Step 10) |
| `land`: `mergeStateStatus: BEHIND` | Rebase onto `origin/<default>` and push; don't merge, don't park (Step 10) |
| `land`: a conflict hunk falls outside the Segment's `Files` | STOP and report; resolving it would rewrite work this Segment doesn't own (Step 10) |
| `land`: a required check fails | Root-cause per `playbook:systematic-debugging`, fix, push, re-review per the fix tier; max 3 fix attempts per Segment (Step 10) |
| `land`: check `bucket: cancel`, or the failed step is `Set up job` | Transient, not a code failure: `gh run rerun <id> --failed`, max 2, and it does NOT consume the 3-attempt fix budget (Step 10) |
| `land`: a non-required check fails | Doesn't block the merge; report it as a follow-up, never drop it silently (Step 10) |
| `land`: the CI fix is a formatter failure | Run the project's formatter; never hand-edit lines to satisfy it (Step 10) |
| `land`: the fix diff is reproducible by re-running the formatter/codegen | Tier 0, no re-review; prove it with `git diff --quiet`, don't assert it (Step 10) |
| `land`: fix under 50 lines, inside the Segment's `Files` | Tier 1: one `reviewer` on the fix diff only, focus `correctness` (Step 10) |
| `land`: fix touches logic, a public signature, a security check, or is attempt 2 or 3 | Tier 2: full Step 9 swarm scoped to the Segment before re-attempting the merge (Step 10) |
| `land`: `reviewDecision: REVIEW_REQUIRED` and `--admin` refused | PARK: record `land: PARKED` + verbatim reason, report the PR and what's already green, STOP (Step 10) |
| `land`: `reviewDecision: CHANGES_REQUESTED` | PARK unconditionally; never `--admin` past a human's stated objection, even holding admin rights (Step 10) |
| `land`: required checks not green | Never `--admin`; it bypasses required checks too. Fix or park. The 3-attempt cap has no admin escape hatch (Step 10) |
| `land`: `gh pr merge` fails with "asynchronous merge REST API" | The PR's base is another open PR's branch, which `land` forbids: report the topology invariant as violated and STOP (Step 10) |
| `land`: resume lands on a Segment recorded `PARKED` | Re-check `gh pr view <n> --json state,mergedAt,reviewDecision` FIRST. `MERGED` -> continue; `APPROVED` -> re-enter at the merge attempt only; still blocked -> report and stop, redoing nothing (Step 10) |
| `land`: Segment reads `MERGED` | `git fetch origin <default>`; `git diff origin/<default> <segment-branch> -- <Segment Files>` MUST be empty before Segment N+1's branch is created (Step 10) |
| `land`: a re-split fired (`s<N>b`) | Don't open `s<N>b`'s PR yet: land the current Segment, then `git rebase --onto origin/<default> <split-sha>` and deliver it against the default branch (Step 5) |
| `land`: any `gh pr merge` invocation | Never pass `--delete-branch`; it deletes the local branch even when the merge fails (Step 10) |
