//! The central invariant a `settings.json` command must satisfy: it
//! RESOLVES. Two defects shipped, or nearly shipped, while every existing
//! test stayed green, because every one of them asserted only what was
//! WRITTEN to `settings.json`, never that the written thing exists and
//! actually runs:
//!
//! - `playbook init` once wrote four `~/.claude/hooks/<name>.sh` guard
//!   commands into `settings.json` while placing none of the scripts.
//! - `settings.shared.json` once seeded those same commands directly,
//!   bypassing the gate meant to stop exactly that.
//!
//! A `settings.json` command naming a missing script fails OPEN and silent:
//! Claude Code invokes it, the file is not there, nothing runs, nothing is
//! reported. This module runs a real `playbook init` against a scratch
//! `$HOME`, walks EVERY command anywhere under the resulting `.hooks`, and
//! asserts each one resolves:
//! - a bare `playbook hook <name>` command: `<name>` must be a hook the
//!   compiled binary actually accepts, derived from the binary's own
//!   `playbook hook --help` output rather than a hardcoded list here, so a
//!   hook added or renamed in `HookName` without ever being wired to match is
//!   caught the same way a user's shell would catch it: the command runs and
//!   clap rejects it.
//! - any command naming a filesystem path: that path must exist on disk and
//!   be executable.
//! - anything in neither shape fails the test loudly rather than being
//!   skipped, since an unrecognised command shape is exactly how something
//!   slips through unresolved.
//!
//! The walk itself is asserted non-vacuous: a walk that silently visits zero
//! commands would pass every assertion below trivially, which is the same
//! class of bug as the two defects this module exists to catch.
