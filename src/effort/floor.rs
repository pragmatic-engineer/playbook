//! The quality floor table (ADR-0022). For each agent it records the lowest
//! effort the maintainer accepts, whether a missed finding is costly, whether
//! the agent is dispatched many times per task on purpose, and where the
//! number came from.
//!
//! This table is the only thing that grants permission to lower effort.
//! Usage evidence can trigger or veto a proposal and never grants one.
//!
//! A floor is the lowest level that held quality in the benchmark campaign of
//! 2026-10-10 (rule: pass rate at least 95% and within 3 points of the best
//! setting, and seeded finding recall within 3 points for review agents). When
//! the bench is thin (single turn with no tools, a pilot of a few cases, or a
//! result that is not monotonic across levels) the floor is pinned to the
//! shipped effort, so nothing is proposed. Every agent is pinned to its shipped
//! effort today. A row moves below shipped only when a larger bench says so,
//! and `tests/effort_floor.rs` checks that every agent has a row and that no
//! floor is above the effort in the agent's file.

/// One agent's floor.
