//! Wires the 20 hooks Claude Code can invoke into `settings.json` as a bare
//! `playbook hook <name>` command: 14 functional hooks plus 6 guards.
//!
//! `GUARD_SPECS` stays a separate list from `PORTED_HOOK_SPECS` because the
//! two mirror different sources: `PORTED_HOOK_SPECS` is the 14 functional
//! hooks, while `GUARD_SPECS` is the guards
//! `settings.json` wires directly, carrying their own `if` and `timeout`
//! fields hooks.json never had. `wire` treats both lists identically: every
//! entry in either is upserted unconditionally through `upsert_hook`. A
//! pre-existing legacy command for an entry, if a user still has one, is
//! replaced in place rather than left to coexist with the new bare command
//! (`entry_targets` recognises both forms as targeting the same hook, so
//! `upsert_hook` rewrites the same array slot rather than appending a second
//! entry).
//!
//! `wire` is mostly an upsert into whatever `settings.json` already has,
//! never a wholesale replace: a hand-added hook entry a user placed
//! alongside one of ours, or an entire event/matcher group we do not manage,
//! survives untouched. This is the same clobber risk `src/init/merge.rs`'s
//! mandatory fixture 6 pins at the settings-merge layer; `wire` pins it
//! again at the narrower hook-wiring layer, since it edits `.hooks` directly
//! rather than going through a three-way merge.
//!
//! The bare-name form (`playbook hook session-init`, not an absolute path)
//! is deliberate: Claude Code already accepts a bare command resolved on
//! PATH for a hand-written hook entry, so `playbook`, installed the same
//! way, resolves the same way. `tests/init_wire.rs` asserts this rather than
//! trusting it.
