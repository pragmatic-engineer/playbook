# Internals: Codex skills

`playbook skills sync` copies playbook skills and commands into Codex's skill folder. The code is in `crates/cli/src/skills_sync/`. The reasoning for multi-agent support is in [ADR 0015](../adr/0015-multi-agent-support.md).

Status: shipped for Codex. The planner, renderer, apply step, `playbook skills sync` command, upgrade-time refresh and uninstall step all exist.

## Where the copies go

The target is `~/.agents/skills`, the user skill path in the [Codex skills docs](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills) (read 2026-10-19) and in Codex source (`codex-rs/ext/skills/src/host_roots.rs`, which calls `$CODEX_HOME/skills` deprecated). It is not `~/.codex/skills`.

- Codex counts as present when `~/.codex` is a folder or `codex` is on `PATH`.
- `CODEX_HOME` is not read, because the skills path does not depend on it.
- The first install needs an explicit `playbook skills sync`, because `~/.agents/skills` is your folder. After that, playbook refreshes only the folders it wrote and recorded.

## Names

- Skill `plugins/playbook/skills/<s>/` becomes `playbook-<s>/`.
- Command `commands/<c>.md` becomes `playbook-<c>/SKILL.md`.

The prefix avoids clashes with your own skills and other agents that read the folder. A name over 64 characters, or a skill and a command with the same name, is an error. The planner has a test that runs on the real plugin folder.

## Copies, not links

Each folder is a real copy. A symlink would break when an update replaces the plugin cache, and Codex would see a dead skill.

## Rendering rules

- A skill keeps every file, including `references/`. The `name:` in `SKILL.md` becomes `playbook-<s>`.
- A command keeps only `name` and `description` in its frontmatter. The body gets a short preamble: this is the playbook command for Codex, run it as `$playbook-<c>`, and what to do when a step names a tool Codex lacks.
- Codex truncates a skill's main prompt at 8,000 bytes on one read path. A rendered `SKILL.md` over that keeps its frontmatter, the preamble and one line telling the agent to read `references/playbook-body.md`. The full body goes in that file.
- In every copied `.md`: `/playbook:<n>` becomes `$playbook-<n>`, `playbook:<n>` becomes `playbook-<n>`, and `../skills/<n>/` becomes `../playbook-<n>/`. This applies only when `<n>` is a name the plugin ships and the match ends at a word boundary. Other text, such as a URL or the key `update.plugin`, stays as written.

## Ownership

Playbook records, per folder, the plugin version and a hash of every file it wrote.

| Folder state | Result |
|---|---|
| Not written by playbook, edited by you, or has a file the record does not list | Left alone, reported |
| Record matches | Replaced |
| Recorded, no longer shipped, still matches | Removed |

Each replacement writes to a temporary folder, records the change as pending, swaps the folders, then records it as done. A crash at any step leaves a folder the next run can replace. One run at a time holds a lock.

> [!NOTE]
> The swap renames the old folder aside, then the new one into place. For a moment one skill folder is missing. A Codex session scanning then misses that skill until its next scan.

## What does not work in Codex

Codex has subagents and no `AskUserQuestion` tool. Playbook does not render its agent files for Codex. A command step that dispatches a playbook agent or asks a question through a tool does not run as written. The preamble tells the agent to do that step itself, to ask Codex to spawn a subagent, or to ask in chat. See the [Codex support matrix](../reference/codex-support.md).

## Open question

Not yet verified in a running Codex: whether an agent follows the one line in a split stub that points at `references/playbook-body.md`. If it does not, skills and commands over 8,000 bytes run with their stub only.
