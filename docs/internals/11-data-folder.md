# Data folder

Every database a playbook tool creates lives in `~/.config/playbook/data`, shared by `playbook`, `pbtop` and `playbook-code`. It is owner only (mode 0700) and is made when the first database opens. `playbook path data` prints it.

## What is in it

| File | Holds | Safe to delete |
|---|---|---|
| `config.db` | All settings: the global, org, repo and per-app tiers, plus the internal `state` table | No: it is your configuration |
| `memory.db` | The memory graph: one row per fact and per link, built from the fact files | Yes: `playbook memory rebuild` makes it again |
| `usage.db` | Token and cost events from the usage view | No: events outlive Claude Code's own history |
| `gate/<owner>/<repo>/<worktree-id>.db` | Gate records of one worktree (`gate record`, `gate check`) | Only when the worktree is gone |
| `code/<owner>/<repo>/<worktree-id>.db` | The code index of one worktree | Yes: `playbook code index` rebuilds it |

Per-worktree files keep worktrees of one repo apart, as the old `repos/<owner>/<repo>/<worktree-id>/` folders did. Memory facts stay Markdown files under `~/.config/playbook/memory` and are the source of truth for `memory.db`. Plans, implement notes and worktree folders stay under `repos/`.

## How databases got here

Earlier versions kept these files elsewhere:

| Now | Before |
|---|---|
| `data/config.db` | `~/.config/playbook/playbook.db` |
| `data/memory.db` | `~/.config/playbook/memory/memory.graph.json` |
| `data/gate/<owner>/<repo>/<worktree-id>.db` | `~/.config/playbook/repos/<owner>/<repo>/<worktree-id>/state.db` |
| `data/code/<owner>/<repo>/<worktree-id>.db` | `~/.config/playbook/repos/<owner>/<repo>/<worktree-id>/code/index.sqlite3` |

The first command that needs a database moves the old file. The move never deletes data found nowhere else:

- Copy: SQLite's `VACUUM INTO` reads a consistent snapshot including the write-ahead log. The copy is checked table by table and renamed into place only if row counts match. Playbook holds the old file's write lock meanwhile, so no writer can add a row between copy and rename.
- Rename: the old file, with its `-wal` and `-shm` files, becomes `<name>.migrated`. An earlier `<name>.migrated` that reads as a sound database came from such a move and so its rows are in the new file, and it is replaced. One that does not read was parked as corrupt and stays, and the new copy takes a numbered name (`.migrated.1`). The `.migrated` copies are kept. Delete them by hand once the new store works. The code index is a cache, so it moves by a plain rename.
- Lock: a folder `<name>.db.migrate.lock` next to the new file stops two processes moving the same file. One older than five minutes is treated as left by a killed process.
- Notice: one line to stderr, only on a terminal. Hooks never print it.

If the move cannot finish (another process holds the lock, or the old file is busy), the command keeps using the old file for that call, and the next call tries again. A setting or gate verdict is never hidden behind an empty new file.

If both files exist, because an older playbook recreated the old path, the rows are merged by primary key and the old file is renamed again:

| Data | Rule |
|---|---|
| `config.db` | The row with the later `updated_at` wins. Values imported from a leftover `config.json` count as oldest |
| Gate phase rows | The later `recorded_at` wins. The rounds of one plan and phase come whole from one file, never mixed |
| Rows only in the old file | Added |

The graph is the one exception to copying. `memory.graph.json` is derived from the fact files, so `memory.db` is rebuilt from them and the file is renamed to `memory.graph.json.migrated`. If an older playbook writes the file again, it is folded in the same way the next time a tool reads the graph. `playbook memory export --json` prints the graph in the old file's shape.

A file that is not a database is left where it is, or renamed to `.migrated` for the settings database, and the notice names it.

> [!WARNING]
> Older playbook versions (0.25.0 and earlier) keep working but read and write the old paths. Upgrade every installed copy.

## Look at it

`playbook doctor` has a row for the folder: path, file count, kilobytes, any `*.migrated` leftovers or `.tmp-` copies, and per-worktree databases that match no worktree of this clone. Those belong to removed worktrees or another clone of the repo. Check before deleting.

`playbook worktree sweep` and `playbook worktree remove` delete the gate and code databases of the worktree they remove, unless another registered worktree still maps to the same id.

## Uninstall

`playbook uninstall` leaves the data folder alone, like memory and every other piece of state.

## Repo folders

Files that are not databases live under `~/.config/playbook/repos/<owner>/<repo>/`, where `<owner>/<repo>` comes from the `origin` remote. The folder is the same from every checkout and every worktree of the repo, so anyone can work the path out with `git remote get-url origin`.

| Folder | Holds | Printed by |
|---|---|---|
| `plans/` | Plans, their quality reports and checkpoints | `playbook path plans` |
| `implement/` | Per Work Unit briefs and progress notes | `playbook path implement` |
| `worktrees/` | Worktrees `/playbook:implement` creates | `playbook path worktrees` |
| `handoff/` | Handoffs saved with `playbook handoff save` | `playbook path handoff` |

Earlier versions kept `plans/`, `implement/` and `worktrees/` one level deeper, in `<worktree-id>/`, and handoffs for every directory in `runtime/handoff/`. The first call that needs a folder copies old files in. Nothing is deleted or overwritten:

- `plans/` and `implement/` are copied from every old `<worktree-id>/` folder. A name that already exists in the new folder is left alone, and the clash is counted in the note.
- `worktrees/` is not copied. It holds live git checkouts, which a copy would break. Old ones stay where they are and keep working.
- Handoffs for the current directory, and the directories under it, are copied from `runtime/handoff/` the first time a session starts there. A marker in `handoff/.copied/` stops a handoff that a session already read from coming back.
- A `MOVED.txt` beside the old files says where the copy went and marks the copy as done. One line goes to stderr when files were copied.

Outside a repo with an `origin` remote, handoffs stay in `runtime/handoff/` and the other kinds report that no folder can be resolved.
