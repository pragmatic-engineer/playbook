# Install

To see every change `playbook setup` makes before you agree to it, read [What setup installs](05-what-setup-installs.md) and the [hook reference](../reference/hooks.md).

Releases up to v0.34.0 have only the old name (older versions: `playbook init`). It takes the same flags, and it still works on newer releases ([ADR-0040](../adr/0040-rename-init-to-setup.md)).

The first route to try is Homebrew. Use the install script when you have no Homebrew. This page covers every route, requirements, how the binary reaches `PATH`, upgrades, the settings merge and uninstall.

Install order:

1. Homebrew.
2. The install script (`install.sh`), when you have no Homebrew.
3. cargo binstall or mise.
4. A `.deb` or `.rpm` package.
5. The marketplace plugin, for the skills only.

## Pick an install mode

| Mode | Commands, in order | You get | You lack |
|---|---|---|---|
| Skills only | `claude plugin marketplace add pragmatic-engineer/marketplace`, then `claude plugin install playbook@pragmatic-engineer` | Skills, commands and subagents. No hooks, no binary, no change to `settings.json` | Safety guards, status line, hooks, usage, and every step that needs the `playbook` binary |
| Binary only | Homebrew: `brew install pragmatic-engineer/tap/playbook`, then `playbook setup`. Or, with no Homebrew, the install script: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pragmatic-engineer/playbook/main/install.sh \| bash` | The `playbook` command, hooks, guards, status line, memory and usage | The skills and slash commands |
| Both (recommended) | The binary first, then the two skills commands | Everything | Nothing |

The skills are a Claude Code plugin and work on their own. The binary is optional. Installing one never installs the other, and playbook never installs or removes a plugin for you.

When the binary is installed, `playbook setup` adds its hook entries to `~/.claude/settings.json`. In a terminal it asks first. With no terminal and no `--yes`, it leaves your Claude Code settings alone and prints the command to run. `--hooks` or `--yes` is the explicit yes. It merges with the entries you already have. An entry counts as playbook's when its command is exactly one of the `playbook hook <name>` commands `setup` writes, and `playbook uninstall` removes only those. The old `playbook-hooks` plugin is retired. If it is still installed, remove it with `claude plugin uninstall playbook-hooks@pragmatic-engineer`, because its hooks would run next to the ones in `settings.json`.

Which one? Choose skills only if you want to read the skills and nothing else runs on your machine. Choose both for everything else. The binary is a hard dependency of the hooks, guards, status line and usage. Only the skill text works without it. See [Skills without the binary](#skills-without-the-binary).

## Requirements

| Tool | Status | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `claude` | only for the skills | The skills are a Claude Code plugin. The binary, hooks, guards and settings do not need it. |
| `bash` or `zsh` | required | The installer runs in bash, and the `path` part edits a bash or zsh rc file. |
| `git`, `shasum` | required | Used by hooks and the installer. |
| `gh` | optional | Status line PR and CI info, and the build attestation check. |
| `agent-browser` | optional | Browser automation `/playbook:plan` uses for web-only tickets. |

## Install

### Homebrew (first choice)

```bash
brew install pragmatic-engineer/tap/playbook
playbook setup
```

`playbook setup` asks before it adds the hooks to `settings.json`, and writes the `PATH` block so hook shells find the binary even when Homebrew's directory is not on their `PATH`. Homebrew ships only the binary, so `setup` seeds the settings template and the system prompt from copies compiled into it (written to `~/.config/playbook/embedded/`) when no Claude Code plugin is installed. An installed plugin, even an older version, takes precedence. Homebrew on Linux works the same way: install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) for Linux, then run the same two commands. The formula picks the static musl build for x86_64 or arm64, so it needs no system libraries. Brew installs under its own prefix (`/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew` by default) and playbook never asks for `sudo`. Each release installs `playbook` and `pbtop` this way on an x86_64 Ubuntu runner after the tap is updated, and fails the release run when that breaks. Homebrew installs update with `brew upgrade playbook` once the formula is trusted, and `playbook update` refuses a Homebrew install and tells you to use brew.

### Homebrew tap trust

Since Homebrew 6.0.0, a tap that is not official needs explicit trust. This is Homebrew's rule, not a playbook setting.

Install with the fully qualified name. This trusts only that formula:

```bash
brew install pragmatic-engineer/tap/playbook
```

The install records that trust, so a later `brew upgrade playbook` works by short name. To install by short name without using the full name first, trust the formula:

```bash
brew tap pragmatic-engineer/tap
brew trust --formula pragmatic-engineer/tap/playbook
brew install playbook
```

`pbtop` is a separate formula. Trust it on its own: `brew trust --formula pragmatic-engineer/tap/pbtop`.

To trust the whole tap, run `brew trust pragmatic-engineer/tap`. This covers every current and future formula in the tap. It is broader, so prefer per-formula trust.

Run `brew trust` to list trusted entries. Run `brew untrust <target>` to remove trust, for example `brew untrust --formula pragmatic-engineer/tap/playbook`. If Homebrew says a formula is not trusted, run the trust command it names. Homebrew stores the entries in `~/.homebrew/trust.json`, or in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/homebrew/trust.json` when `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set. See Homebrew's own page on tap trust.

### Install script

Use this when you have no Homebrew. install.sh is a bash script, so it does not run on Windows. On Windows, use [Without `curl | bash`](#without-curl--bash).

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pragmatic-engineer/playbook/main/install.sh | bash
```

It installs only the `playbook` binary, into `PLAYBOOK_BIN_DIR` (default `~/.local/bin`), after checking its SHA256, its build attestation when `gh` can check it, and a `--version` smoke test. It puts that directory on `PATH`. It does not touch Claude Code's plugins or settings.

When it replaces an older binary, it prints `playbook updated from A to B.`, then the breaking changes of the new release if there are any, then a link to the full release notes. Before 1.0 a breaking change can ship in any release, so read them.

Then it asks "Run playbook setup now?". Only a typed `y` or `yes` counts, so a bare Enter is a no. On yes it asks about the system prompt that `pb cc` loads (Enter means yes; with `--yes` setup decides, so an earlier no stays), then runs `playbook setup --yes`, which turns every part on: the hook entries, the status line and the telemetry variables (a collector on this machine) in `settings.json`, the system prompt, the `pb` link and the rest. A no to the prompt question passes `--no-system-prompt`. On no, or with no terminal and no `--yes`, it skips `setup` and prints the command to run later, with `--system-prompt` or `--no-system-prompt` if you passed one. Open a new terminal afterward.

Pass `--yes` to say yes to every question, including `playbook setup`. Flags go after `-s --` when piping:

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--yes`, `-y` | Say yes to every question, including running `playbook setup`. |
| `--no-init` | Install the binary only. Do not ask about `playbook setup`. |
| `--system-prompt` | Install the system prompt without asking. |
| `--no-system-prompt` | Keep `pb cc` on Claude Code's own prompt, without asking. |
| `--binary-only` | Still offers `playbook setup`, but keeps the system prompt off (passes `--no-system-prompt`). |
| `--ref <tag>` | Release tag, same as `PLAYBOOK_REF`. |

`--skip-plugin`, `--no-setup`, `--skip-deps`, `--skip-shell` and `--aliases` are accepted and ignored, so older commands keep working. `--aliases` prints a warning, because `playbook cc` and `pb cc` need no shell line (ADR 0044). `--skills-only` is gone and exits with the plugin commands. The other `setup` options, such as `--short-name`, belong to `playbook setup`; run it yourself to pass them, and install.sh also links `pb` to `playbook` when the name is free.

Pin a version with `PLAYBOOK_REF`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pragmatic-engineer/playbook/main/install.sh | PLAYBOOK_REF=v0.39.0 bash
```

A release tag installs that release. A branch or commit is refused, because it has no published binary.

### cargo binstall and mise

Both fetch the release binary for your platform. binstall builds from source only when no release binary matches.

```bash
cargo binstall --git https://github.com/pragmatic-engineer/playbook playbook
mise use github:pragmatic-engineer/playbook
```

`cargo binstall` reads `[package.metadata.binstall]` in `crates/cli/Cargo.toml`, which names the `playbook-<version>-<target>` asset of the release. Pass `--git`: the crate name `playbook` on crates.io belongs to another project, so `cargo binstall playbook` without it installs that one, and playbook is not published there. The metadata turns off binstall's quick-install service for the same reason. mise's `github` backend finds the same asset by the operating system and architecture in its name, and needs no registry entry.

Neither route checks `SHA256SUMS` or the attestation for you, so use [Without `curl | bash`](#without-curl--bash) below when you want those checks. Each release installs playbook both ways in an empty `HOME` and compares the file with its `SHA256SUMS` line and its attestation. A test (`scripts/asset-names.test.sh`) fails when the asset names change, because both tools depend on them. Neither tool links `pb`, so run `playbook setup` for the link.

### Nix

```bash
nix run github:pragmatic-engineer/playbook -- --version
nix profile install github:pragmatic-engineer/playbook
playbook setup
```

The flake in this repository fetches the release binary for `x86_64-linux`, `aarch64-linux`, `x86_64-darwin` or `aarch64-darwin` and checks it against a fixed hash. It ships `playbook` only, not `pbtop`. After each release a pull request moves `flake.nix` to the new version, so `main` is one release behind for a short while. A tag does not help here: tags are made before the hashes exist, so `github:pragmatic-engineer/playbook/vX.Y.Z` carries the flake of the release before it. To pin a version, use the merge commit of the `chore(release): nix flake X.Y.Z` pull request, for example `github:pragmatic-engineer/playbook/<commit>`. To roll back, pin the commit of the earlier flake pull request. Each release runs the flake on Linux and macOS after the pull request merges. A Nix install is read-only. The automatic update shows a notice that the install directory is not writable, and `playbook update` stops with "cannot write to" the store path. Update with `nix profile upgrade playbook` instead. Your config is not touched.

### Arch Linux (AUR)

```bash
yay -S playbook-bin        # or any AUR helper, or: git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/playbook-bin.git && cd playbook-bin && makepkg -si
playbook setup
```

`playbook-bin` installs the static release binary for `x86_64` or `aarch64` as `/usr/bin/playbook`, after makepkg checks it against the SHA256 of the release `SHA256SUMS`. It ships `playbook` only: no `pb` link (`playbook setup` makes it), no `pbtop`. It conflicts with and provides `playbook`. The package owns nothing under `/etc` or your home folder, so an upgrade or a removal leaves your config alone, and `playbook migrate` runs on first use. Pacman owns `/usr/bin/playbook`, so update with your AUR helper (`yay -Syu`). The automatic updater leaves a binary it cannot write alone and shows a notice, but do not run `sudo playbook update`, because it would replace a file pacman owns. The release workflow pushes the package right after a release and builds it from the AUR in a clean Arch container, so the AUR can trail a release by a few minutes. makepkg checks the SHA256 only. To check the build attestation too, use [Without `curl | bash`](#without-curl--bash) below.

### Debian, Ubuntu and Fedora packages

Each release has a `.deb` and an `.rpm` for x86_64 and arm64. They hold the static `playbook` and `pbtop` binaries and the `pb` link in `/usr/bin`, with no dependencies. Download the file for your machine and `SHA256SUMS` from the [latest release](https://github.com/pragmatic-engineer/playbook/releases/latest), check them as in [Without `curl | bash`](#without-curl--bash) below, then install with your package manager, which asks for its own privileges (`playbook` never runs `sudo`):

```bash
sudo apt install ./playbook_<version>_amd64.deb     # Debian, Ubuntu (arm64: _arm64.deb)
sudo dnf install ./playbook-<version>.x86_64.rpm    # Fedora, RHEL (arm64: aarch64.rpm)
playbook setup
```

An upgrade installs the newer file the same way. The package owns no file under `/etc` or your home folder, so an upgrade or a removal leaves your config alone, and `playbook migrate` runs on first use. The package manager owns `/usr/bin/playbook`, so update with it. Do not run `playbook update` on a package install, because it would replace a file the package manager owns. Each release installs, reinstalls and removes the packages in Debian, Ubuntu and Fedora containers before and after it is published.

### Windows with scoop (experimental)

```powershell
scoop bucket add playbook https://github.com/pragmatic-engineer/scoop-bucket
scoop install playbook
playbook --version
```

Windows is an experimental CLI ([ADR 0053](../adr/0053-windows-experimental-cli.md)). The package puts `playbook.exe` on your PATH and nothing else: it does not run `playbook setup` and does not touch your config. CI checks on Windows that `playbook --version` and `playbook doctor check` run, and reports on `setup`, `uninstall` and the hooks. Not supported:

- PATH wiring and PowerShell profile wiring by `setup`, and the `pb` short name.
- `playbook update`. It is refused on Windows, so update with `scoop update playbook`. To go back, `scoop install playbook@<version>` needs the version in the bucket, or wait for a newer release.
- `pbdoc` and the `doc` command, and `pbtop`.
- Backslash paths in the `rm` guard.
- Whether Claude Code on Windows finds `playbook hook <name>` from `settings.json` is not checked.

The manifest holds the SHA256 of the release binary, copied from the attested `SHA256SUMS`, and scoop checks it on install. The binary has no Authenticode signature. Each release installs the manifest on a clean Windows runner before and after it reaches the bucket.

### Optional: pbtop alone

You do not need this if you have `playbook`. `playbook usage` runs the same code, because playbook embeds the `playbook-telemetry` crate. Install `pbtop`, the usage dashboard, only on a machine that has no `playbook`. From release 0.35.0 each `vX.Y.Z` release has `pbtop-X.Y.Z-<target>.tar.gz`, which holds `pbtop` alone, and there are two ways to install it:

```bash
brew install pragmatic-engineer/tap/pbtop
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pragmatic-engineer/playbook/main/install-pbtop.sh | sh
```

The Homebrew route needs tap trust. The full name trusts only `pbtop`. See [Homebrew tap trust](#homebrew-tap-trust).

`install-pbtop.sh` needs `bash` and `curl`. It downloads `install.sh` from `main` and runs it in its pbtop mode, which checks the archive like the `playbook` binary (its line in `SHA256SUMS`, the build attestation when `gh` can check it, and `pbtop --version`), installs `pbtop` into `PLAYBOOK_BIN_DIR` (default `~/.local/bin`) and puts that folder on `PATH`. It runs nothing else. To pin a release, set `PLAYBOOK_REF` for `sh`, as in `curl -fsSL .../install-pbtop.sh | PLAYBOOK_REF=v0.39.0 sh`. On a release before 0.35.0 it stops, because those have no `pbtop` archive. The old `install.sh --pbtop` still works for one more release and points to `install-pbtop.sh`.

Type `pbtop`, `pbtop --summary`, `pbtop --json` or `pbtop --range 30d`. The [crate README](../../crates/telemetry/README.md) covers `cargo` builds. The `playbook-telemetry` command and formula are retired ([ADR 0041](../adr/0041-retire-playbook-telemetry.md)): with Homebrew, run `brew uninstall playbook-telemetry && brew install pragmatic-engineer/tap/pbtop`, and change a script that calls `playbook-telemetry` to call `pbtop` with the same arguments. Everything stays on your machine.

The tool shares its data with playbook: the database is `~/.config/playbook/data/usage.db` and the settings are the `usage.*` keys in `~/.config/playbook/data/config.db`. See [Config keys](../reference/config-keys.md).

### Without `curl | bash`

1. From the [latest release](https://github.com/pragmatic-engineer/playbook/releases/latest), download the asset for your platform and `SHA256SUMS`.

   | Platform | Asset |
   |---|---|
   | macOS, Apple silicon | `playbook-<version>-aarch64-apple-darwin` |
   | macOS, Intel | `playbook-<version>-x86_64-apple-darwin` |
   | Linux, x86_64 | `playbook-<version>-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` |
   | Linux, arm64 | `playbook-<version>-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` |
   | Windows (experimental, or use [scoop](#windows-with-scoop-experimental)) | `playbook-<version>-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe` |

2. Verify it. `SHA256SUMS` is not signed, so it is only a corruption check. The attestation shows where the binary was built.

   ```bash
   grep "  <asset>$" SHA256SUMS | shasum -a 256 -c -
   gh attestation verify <asset> --repo pragmatic-engineer/playbook
   ```

   `install.sh` and `playbook update` run the attestation check when `gh` is available. They warn when `gh` is missing or the release predates attestations, and abort on a real mismatch. Set `PLAYBOOK_REQUIRE_ATTESTATION=1` to abort on a missing check too.

3. Put it on `PATH`:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
   mv <asset> ~/.local/bin/playbook
   chmod 0755 ~/.local/bin/playbook
   ```

4. Wire the local config:

   ```bash
   playbook setup
   ```

   In a terminal, `setup` asks about hooks, settings, the status line, `PATH`, the system prompt and the `pb` short name. The status line question reads "Use the playbook status line?" and has `--statusline` and `--no-statusline`. Answering no leaves `statusLine` in `settings.json` as it is, and an existing playbook status line stays until `playbook uninstall`. Each part has `--x` and `--no-x` flags. With `--yes`, hooks, settings, the status line, `PATH`, the system prompt and the `pb` link are on. `--yes` keeps the system prompt off when `systemPrompt.enabled` is false or on an earlier install that had none, and keeps the `pb` link off after a stored no. Without a terminal and without `--yes`, the hooks, the status line, the system prompt, the `pb` link and telemetry stay off unless you pass their flag. Every step is safe to repeat.

5. For the skills, run the two plugin commands from [Pick an install mode](#pick-an-install-mode). Then run `/playbook:doctor`, or `playbook doctor check` without the skills.

## Upgrade

| Install | Command |
|---|---|
| Homebrew | `brew upgrade playbook` |
| Install script | `playbook update`, or run the installer again (`--check` to look, `--list` for releases, `--pre` for pre-releases, `--yes` in auto mode) |
| Arch Linux (AUR) | `yay -Syu`, or `git pull` in the clone of `playbook-bin` and `makepkg -si` |
| Nix | `nix profile upgrade playbook` for a profile install, or `nix flake update` where the flake is an input |

`playbook update` verifies SHA256SUMS and the attestation, keeps the old binary as `playbook.<version>.bak` (the newest three are kept), refuses a Homebrew install, and warns when another `playbook` earlier on `PATH` hides the new one. The binary and the plugin share one version line ([ADR 0038](../adr/0038-one-release-line.md)), and they work together while they are on the same MAJOR.MINOR. The plugin follows the binary on its own. After the binary, `playbook update` updates the plugin with `claude plugin update playbook@pragmatic-engineer` and says to restart Claude Code, and `playbook migrate` does the same. After a `brew upgrade` or an automatic update, the first playbook command you run at a terminal does it, and so does the next Claude Code session, which starts it in the background and never waits for it. Each binary version is updated once. A failed attempt, or one that leaves the plugin on the old version, is tried again after 24 hours. Without the `claude` command, or when the update fails, playbook prints that command for you to run, and `playbook doctor` warns until the plugin is on the binary's minor line. The automatic step after an upgrade is skipped in CI, in headless runs, when stderr is not a terminal (the session hook is not affected by that rule), when the plugin is turned off in Claude Code, and when `PLAYBOOK_SKIP_PLUGIN_UPDATE=1` is set. `playbook update` and `playbook migrate` still update in those runs unless `update.plugin` is `off`. `--no-plugin` skips the update for one run of either command. `playbook config set update.plugin ask` makes the first command at a terminal ask before it updates, and `playbook config set update.plugin off` turns it off, so you run `claude plugin update playbook@pragmatic-engineer` yourself. When something needs you after an upgrade, the next session lists it, one bullet per item with why it matters and the command that fixes it. It shows each item once, then at most once a day. A list that `playbook migrate` printed in your terminal counts as shown: a setup item comes back after a day and a report does not come back. `playbook migrate --status` shows the list again. See [What needs you](../internals/07-migrations.md#what-needs-you). A binary pinned with `PLAYBOOK_REF` gets the same warning once the plugin moves to a newer minor line. To roll back, move a backup over the binary:

```bash
mv -f ~/.local/bin/playbook.0.19.0.bak ~/.local/bin/playbook
```

### Update notices and automatic updates

Playbook looks for a newer release on its own, the way Claude Code does. The `update.mode` setting picks what happens:

| `update.mode` | What happens |
|---|---|
| `notify` (default) | A command run in a terminal prints one line on stderr when a newer release exists: `playbook X.Y.Z is available (you have A.B.C). Run: playbook update`. Homebrew installs see `brew upgrade playbook`. On an install that can update itself, the line also names `playbook config set --global update.mode auto`. The line shows at most once in 24 hours for each version. |
| `auto` | Playbook installs the release in the background, with the same checks as `playbook update`, and runs the new binary's migrations. The command you ran finishes on the old binary. The next command you run in a terminal prints `playbook updated from A.B.C to X.Y.Z. Release notes: <url>`. |
| `off` | No check runs. |

Turn on automatic updates with:

```bash
playbook config set --global update.mode auto
```

`update.mode`, `update.checkIntervalHours` and `update.plugin` are settings for each user, so `config set` writes them to the global tier even without `--global` and refuses `--org`.

How the check works:

- A command reads the last result from `~/.config/playbook/data/config.db`. When that result is older than `update.checkIntervalHours` (24 by default), the command starts a background process that asks the GitHub releases API for the newest `vX.Y.Z` release. No command waits on the network. The request is unauthenticated, and its only identifying header is the `playbook/<version>` user agent. GitHub sees your IP address, as with any request. In `auto` mode the background process also downloads the release and checks its attestation through `gh`, the same requests `playbook update` makes. Offline, rate limited or behind a proxy, the check stays silent and runs again after the next interval.
- The check does not run for hooks, the status line, `version`, `json`, `update`, the background `usage warm` and `usage collect` runs, any run with `--json`, or when a CI variable or `PLAYBOOK_HEADLESS` is set. The notice needs a terminal on stderr. An automatic update does not.
- `auto` falls back to the notice, with the reason, in these cases: a Homebrew install; a platform `playbook update` does not support, such as Windows; a development or release candidate build; a release less than an hour old, or one whose publish time is unknown; an install directory you cannot write; another update in progress; a release whose notes list a breaking change, follow a release this binary has not seen, or cannot be read; and a build attestation that cannot be checked, for example when `gh` is missing. A failed automatic update prints one warning with the fix. When an attempt never runs, for example on an offline machine, the notice shows after 15 minutes.
- `playbook update --check` and `playbook doctor` show the mode, the last check and what it found.

### Coming from the playbook-hooks plugin

Older releases delivered the hooks in a second plugin, `playbook-hooks`. The hooks now live in `~/.claude/settings.json`. After you upgrade the binary, run these two commands once:

```bash
claude plugin uninstall playbook-hooks@pragmatic-engineer
playbook setup --yes
```

`playbook setup` adds the hook entries and asks first when you run it in a terminal. Leaving the old plugin installed makes every hook run twice, and `playbook doctor check` points it out.

### Coming from the shell launcher

Older setups added a line to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` that runs `eval "$(playbook shell-init)"`, and some users wrote it by hand. The `shell-init` command is removed. Start sessions with `pb cc` or `pb ccd`, or `playbook cc` and `playbook ccd`. Delete the line from your rc file, or run `playbook setup`, which removes it after a backup (the `retired-launcher-rc-line` migration). `playbook doctor` warns while the line is there. Until 1.0, an rc file that still runs the line prints one line on stderr when a shell starts and nothing else, so the shell still starts.

See [release channels](../internals/06-release-channels.md) for how a release reaches each channel.

## How the binary gets on PATH

Every route ends with `playbook` on `PATH` for each shell start.

| Shell | File that gets the `# playbook binary` block |
|---|---|
| zsh | `~/.zshenv` (read by every zsh, including non-interactive ones) |
| bash | `~/.bashrc` and the login file (`~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bash_login` or `~/.profile`, whichever exists first) |
| fish | `~/.config/fish/conf.d/playbook.fish` |
| other | `~/.profile` |

`install.sh` and `playbook setup` write the same block and skip a file that already names the directory.

Hooks do not read these files. Measured on Claude Code 2.1.293 (2026-10-09), a hook runs in a non-interactive `bash -c` with exactly the `PATH` of the process that started Claude Code. So:

- **Started from a terminal:** the inherited `PATH` has the block's directory. Hooks find `playbook`.
- **Started with `playbook cc` or `playbook ccd`:** the launcher adds the binary's directory when it is missing.
- **Started from a desktop app or IDE:** hooks find `playbook` only if its directory is already on that `PATH`. Use `playbook cc`, or install with `PLAYBOOK_BIN_DIR` set to a directory that environment has.

## Setup flags

`playbook setup` has one flag pair per part: `--hooks`, `--statusline`, `--security`, `--path`, `--system-prompt`, `--telemetry`, `--short-name`, `--policy-guard` and `--attribution`, each with a `--no-` form. For attribution, `--attribution` is ON (Claude Code adds its trailer and session link) and `--no-attribution` is OFF, the default. `--aliases` and `--claude-override` are retired: setup accepts them, prints a note and does nothing. With `--yes` or in a terminal, every part but `--security` and `--policy-guard` is on by default, and attribution is OFF by default. `--yes` keeps the system prompt off when `systemPrompt.enabled` is false or on an earlier install that had none, and keeps the `pb` link off after a stored no. Without a terminal and without `--yes`, hooks, the status line, the system prompt, telemetry, the collector service and the `pb` link stay off, and attribution is left as it is, unless their flag is passed. `--only <part>[,<part>]` runs just the named parts, so `playbook setup --only telemetry` turns telemetry on and touches nothing else. A bare `--telemetry` (no `--yes` and no other part flag) means the same. The permissions rules (`--security`) stay off unless you pass the flag or set `security.defaults`.


## Find a command

`playbook commands` prints one line per command with its subcommands, what it does and who may run it. `(read-only)` commands only read. A `(user-only)` command, or a name ending in `!`, changes your home or Claude Code settings, needs your consent, runs a paid benchmark or starts a session, so a Claude session asks you to type it with `!` instead of running it. `playbook commands <group>`, such as `playbook commands pr`, lists the subcommands of one group with their flags, and `--json` prints the same for scripts. The list comes from the binary itself, so it names only the commands the binary has. Inside Claude Code, the `playbook:playbook-usage` skill points a session to this list. Every flag is in the [CLI and config reference](../reference/cli-and-config.md).

`playbook --help` groups the commands by audience. The first list is for you. A second list, "Agent commands", holds the commands that skills and agents call. When you run a command without a required argument or subcommand, it prints that command's full help to stderr and exits with code 2. A missing argument adds one `error:` line that names it.

## Shell completions

`playbook completions bash`, `playbook completions zsh` and `playbook completions fish` print a completion script on stdout. Nothing is written to your shell files. Load the script from your own shell setup, for example `source <(playbook completions bash)` in `~/.bashrc`. The script also completes `pb`, but only when `pb` on your `PATH` is the same file as `playbook`. `playbook setup` does not install completions.

## Skills without the binary

With the skills plugin alone, some commands call the `playbook` binary. They fall back to plain git, gh and file steps where they can. No hook runs, so the guards and status line are not active, and `/playbook:doctor` reports the binary and the hook entries as missing. Install the binary and run `playbook setup` to add them.

## Use playbook's skills in Codex

```bash
playbook skills sync --dry-run   # list what would be written, change nothing
playbook skills sync             # write it
```

The command copies the playbook skills and commands into `~/.agents/skills/playbook-<name>/`, the user skill folder Codex reads. Each command becomes a skill, so `/playbook:plan` is `$playbook-plan` in Codex. It needs Codex on the machine: a `~/.codex` folder or `codex` on your `PATH`.

It never touches a folder it did not write, or one you edited. Those are left as they are and listed in the output. When the plugin updates, playbook adds, updates and removes its own folders to match, and only for an agent you already synced. A folder you deleted is not written again. To opt out, do not run the command. `playbook uninstall` removes the folders that `skills sync` wrote and you did not edit.

Codex has no subagents and no `AskUserQuestion` tool, so a command step that needs one is done by the agent itself or asked in chat. A rendered skill over 8,000 bytes is written as a short stub that tells the agent to read `references/playbook-body.md`. Whether a running Codex follows that line has not been verified. See [Codex skills](../internals/15-codex-skills.md).

## Settings merge

`playbook setup` merges the shipped template into your `settings.json` and never overwrites it. The template carries three things, each behind its own part: the `hooks` block, the `statusLine` and, only when you opt in, the `permissions` block. It ships no display options, notification toggles or `env` entries, because no hook or launcher reads them. Keys you customised stay as you set them. Keys an older template shipped (`cleanupPeriodDays`, `outputStyle`, `env` and the like) stay in your file too, and setup never removes them.

The retired `--settings` and `--no-settings` flags are gone. Use `--hooks`, `--statusline` and `--security` and their `--no-` forms instead.

It tracks a baseline in `~/.claude/.settings.base.json` and compares it with the new template and your live file. After each run, `$CLAUDE_HOME/settings-merge-skipped.<epoch>.json` lists every key where your value won, as `{"key":"...", "template_had":..., "yours":...}`. Review it and adopt template values by hand if you want them.

The security defaults, the `permissions` block, are opt-in. A plain `playbook setup` does not add them and never removes ones you have. Update control (the Claude Code autoupdater) is left to you, `playbook update` and Homebrew. Pass `--security` or set `security.defaults` to true to merge them. `permissions` is one top-level key. If you customised it, the whole block counts as contested and the template's version is withheld, so your rules win. See [Security defaults](13-security-defaults.md).

If a run is interrupted between writing `settings.json` and the baseline, delete `.settings.base.json`. The next run treats the missing baseline as empty and only adds keys.

## Disabling the plugin

Disabling `playbook@pragmatic-engineer` in Claude Code pauses playbook. Every hook, including the safety guards, exits as a silent success and the status line prints nothing, while the entries `playbook setup` wrote stay in `settings.json`. Enable the plugin again to resume. Only an explicit `false` pauses: with no entry (a binary-only install), `true`, or a `settings.json` that cannot be read, playbook runs as usual. To run hooks anyway, set `PLAYBOOK_IGNORE_PLUGIN_DISABLED=1` in the environment Claude Code starts in. See [Launcher and hooks](../internals/01-launcher-and-hooks.md#pausing-when-the-plugin-is-disabled).

## Uninstall

```bash
playbook uninstall --dry-run   # list what would go, change nothing
playbook uninstall --yes       # remove it
```

It removes only what playbook placed: the hook entries whose command is exactly one `playbook hook <name>` command that `setup` writes and status line in `settings.json`, the launcher block in your rc files, and the files under `~/.config/playbook` that playbook copied (such as the system prompt). Without `--yes` it lists the plan and exits with status 1.

Everything else stays: the rest of `settings.json` and your rc files, `.settings.base.json`, `backups/`, memory, the [data folder](../internals/11-data-folder.md) with every database, and all runtime state. Each changed file is backed up first (`settings.json.bak.<epoch>`). A status line script or system prompt you edited by hand is kept. If `settings.json` cannot be edited, such as invalid JSON, the placed files and the binary stay too.

At the end it lists the manual steps that still apply, because playbook does not remove Claude Code's plugins: `claude plugin uninstall playbook@pragmatic-engineer` while it is installed, `claude plugin uninstall playbook-hooks@pragmatic-engineer` if the retired hooks plugin is still there, and `claude plugin marketplace remove pragmatic-engineer` while the marketplace is listed.

`--remove-binary` also removes the binary, its `.bak` backups and the `PATH` block the installer added.

## Notes

Edits to `settings.json` or hooks take effect in a fresh session only. Run `playbook cc fresh` or plain `claude` after changing them. `playbook cc` warns when a resumed session runs on stale config.
