# Telemetry

`playbook setup` asks whether to send Claude Code telemetry to a collector on your own machine. The answer defaults to yes. It writes eight OpenTelemetry variables into the `env` block of `~/.claude/settings.json`, so plain `claude`, the IDE and the desktop app feed `playbook usage`.

Prompt text and tool content are never sent. Nothing leaves your machine. The collector listens on 127.0.0.1 only. Playbook's `session-init` hook (part of the hooks you install with setup) starts it when a session begins. Without those hooks, start it with `playbook usage collect`, or let `playbook cc` do it.

- To turn it on later, or after you declined: `playbook setup --only telemetry`.
- If `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY` is 0 in `~/.claude/settings.json` and nothing else sets telemetry, `--yes` leaves it alone. Answer yes to the question or run `playbook setup --only telemetry`.
- If telemetry is set in project settings, your shell or next to other `OTEL_` keys, setup leaves all of it as it is (see [What setup installs](05-what-setup-installs.md)).
- `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` and `DO_NOT_TRACK` only turn off Anthropic's own analytics and are left as they are.
- Restart Claude Code after setup, because it reads settings at start.
- `playbook doctor` checks that settings point at the collector, that it runs, and that rows arrived in the last day.
- `playbook uninstall` removes exactly the keys setup wrote and puts back any value they replaced, unless you changed a key since.
