# Playbook docs

How to use and extend this Claude Code config. The [README](../README.md) covers install, the launcher and a short summary of every command. These pages go deeper: why the config is shaped the way it is, real workflows end to end, how to add your own pieces, and how the machine works underneath.

Read them in order, or jump to what you need.

## Concepts

Why the foundations work the way they do.

- [The system prompt](concepts/01-system-prompt.md): what the custom prompt defines, and why a custom prompt behaves better than the default.
- [The memory system](concepts/02-memory-system.md): the global, org, and project fact store, typed edges, and how it feeds the commands.
- [Why the pieces are shaped this way](concepts/03-why-the-pieces-are-shaped-this-way.md): why commands, skills, agents and hooks are separate, why each model and effort level was chosen, and where to change them.

## Guides

Task-oriented workflows.

- [Install](guides/00-install.md): requirements, every install route, upgrade and uninstall.
- [Plan and implement](guides/01-plan-and-implement.md): design with `/playbook:plan`, build with `/playbook:implement`, fix a small bug with `/playbook:fix`.
- [Review and PR flow](guides/02-review-and-pr-flow.md): commit, review, and work through feedback.
- [Decisions and memory](guides/03-decisions-and-memory.md): record choices with `/playbook:adr`, build project knowledge with `/playbook:learn-project`.
- [Config keys](guides/04-config-keys.md): every `playbook config` key with its default, allowed values and what it does.
- [The rm guard](guides/08-rm-guard.md): what the guard reads as a deletion, the roots it allows per OS, what stays blocked and how to add a root.
- [Auto mode](guides/05-auto-mode.md): run commands without questions, with a spend cap.
- [What setup installs](guides/06-what-init-installs.md): every change `playbook setup` makes, what stays on your machine, and how to undo each part.
- [Reading documents](guides/07-reading-documents.md): read a PDF or Office file as cheaper text with the optional anydoc converter.
- [Hook reference](reference/hooks.md): every hook setup wires, with its event, matcher, what it reads and writes, and how to turn it off.
- [CLI and config reference](reference/cli-and-config.md): every command, flag and config key, generated from the code so it cannot drift.

## Authoring

Extend the config.

- [Commands, skills, and hooks](authoring/01-commands-skills-hooks.md): templates for each extension point.
- [Authoring agents](authoring/02-authoring-agents.md): the frontmatter schema, both binding mechanisms, and the parametrize or split rule.

## Internals

How the machine works.

- [Launcher and hooks](internals/01-launcher-and-hooks.md): the `playbook cc` launcher and the hook lifecycle.
- [Model routing and memory](internals/02-model-routing-and-memory.md): tiers, effort policy, `playbook route` and the memory graph.
- [Worktree engine](internals/03-worktree.md): the `playbook cc launch worktree` background subshell, node_modules cloning, and rebase conflict resolution.
- [Usage view](internals/04-usage-dashboard.md): `playbook usage`, the terminal view and its keys, where the numbers come from and the store.
- [Headless mode](internals/05-headless-mode.md): what runs without a person at the keyboard, real `claude -p` exit codes, how the hooks behave headless, and a first CI use case.
- [Release channels](internals/06-release-channels.md): how a tagged release reaches the GitHub assets and the Homebrew tap.
- [Migrations](internals/07-migrations.md): how `playbook setup` carries an install across breaking changes, the three migration kinds, and how edits to placed files are detected.
- [State store](internals/08-state-store.md): where playbook keeps its internal state, how to inspect it with `playbook state list`, and the one-time import of the old files.
- [Sessions](internals/09-sessions.md): `playbook sessions`, the read only list of recent sessions with repo, branch, worktree, PR, state, context size and cost, and what it never does.
- [Document conversion benchmark](internals/10-document-conversion-benchmark.md): the measurement behind the `docs.convert` default.
- [Data folder](internals/11-data-folder.md): the one folder that holds every database, what each file is, how older files move in, and how to clean up.
