# Codex support

What works in Codex today, what does not, and why. Read from the Codex docs (learn.chatgpt.com and developers.openai.com) on 2026-10-20 and from this repo's code. Nothing here was run in a live Codex, so `[unverified]` marks every claim that needs one. Codex moves fast: check a row against the current Codex docs before you rely on it.

Playbook runs best in Claude Code. Codex gets the skills and, if you wire them by hand, some of the guards.

## Matrix

| Piece | Status | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Skills and commands | Works | `playbook skills sync` copies skills, and commands rendered as skills, to `~/.agents/skills/playbook-*`. See [Codex skills](../internals/15-codex-skills.md). Whether Codex follows the one-line pointer in a split stub to `references/playbook-body.md` is `[unverified]`. |
| Bash guards as hooks | Tested, not registered | `rm-workspace-guard`, `precommit-check` and `commit-message-sanitizer` read `tool_input.command` and print JSON shapes that Codex documents. Tests feed them Codex-shaped payloads (`crates/cli/tests/hooks_codex_payloads.rs`). Nothing registers them in Codex for you. |
| Edit and read hooks | Not supported | Codex has no `Read` tool, and `apply_patch` carries patch text in `tool_input.command` with no `file_path`. These hooks would need a patch parser. |
| `policy-guard` | Not supported | Its rules guard Claude paths such as `~/.claude/projects/*/memory` and `.claude/settings*.json`. Registering it would look like protection and do nothing. |
| `session-init`, `usage-warm` | Not supported | `session-init` reads `~/.claude`, runs the Claude plugin update and writes Claude restart hints. Not safe to register as is. |
| `memory-capture`, `session-clean-exit` | Not supported | `memory-capture` fires on a marker the Claude statusline writes. Codex has no statusline. |
| `auto-guard`, `auto-cost`, `auto-model-detect`, `bg-await-guard` | Not supported | They depend on `AskUserQuestion`, Claude model aliases and `run_in_background`, which Codex does not have. |
| `WorktreeCreate`, `WorktreeRemove` | Not supported | Codex has no worktree event. |
| Agents | Not rendered | Codex has subagents and custom agent TOML files, but no per-agent tool allowlist, and a subagent inherits the parent sandbox. Playbook agents such as the critic, fact-checker and reviewer rely on tool restriction to be read-only, which Codex cannot enforce. The command preamble tells the agent to do the step itself or ask Codex to spawn a subagent. |
| System prompt | Not written | Codex reads `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`. Playbook does not write to it. Skills carry the rules. |
| Doctor | No Codex row | `playbook doctor` checks the Claude layers only. |
| Usage | Works, unpriced | `CodexSource` reads `~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl`. It has no OpenAI price table, so cost shows as unpriced. Compressed `.jsonl.zst` rollouts are skipped. Whether Codex still writes them, and whether a forked session repeats parent events, is `[unverified]`. |
| Plugin distribution | Skills sync only | Codex reads Claude-compatible plugin manifests. Whether it loads the playbook plugin folder directly is `[unverified]`. |
| MCP | Nothing to port | Playbook ships no MCP server. |

## How the guards behave in Codex

- A hook that errors, times out or returns malformed output is reported and the tool call continues. Only an explicit deny or exit code 2 blocks. The Codex docs call hooks "a useful guardrail, not a complete enforcement boundary". Treat the guards as best effort.
- The guards also allow when stdin is empty or not JSON, and for `apply_patch` calls. Tests pin this.
- A hook is skipped until you review and trust its exact definition in `/hooks`.
- `commit-message-sanitizer` rewrites a command by printing `updatedInput` and context, with no `permissionDecision`. The Codex docs describe a rewrite as `permissionDecision: "allow"` with `updatedInput`. Whether Codex applies the form playbook prints is `[unverified]`, and so is whether an allow would skip Codex's own approval prompt for the rewritten command. Do not rely on the sanitizer in Codex until both are checked.
- `precommit-check` has no `if` filter in Codex, so it runs on every Bash call and exits quietly when the command is not a commit. Whether Codex rejects or ignores an `if` field is `[unverified]`.

## Test fixtures

The payloads in `crates/cli/tests/fixtures/codex/` are schema-derived from the Codex hooks docs, not recorded from a running Codex. Each file says so in its `_fixture` header. A recorded `PostToolUse` payload, with the Codex version, is still missing.

## Cursor

Cursor loads `~/.agents/skills/` and `.agents/skills/`, so `playbook skills sync` reaches it too, but this is not verified in a running Cursor. The rendered preamble names `$playbook-<command>`, which is Codex syntax. Cursor hooks use other event names and payloads (`beforeShellExecution` and others), so they would need their own adapter, which is not planned. No public Cursor transcript format is known, so Cursor usage is not supportable today.
