//! Integration tests for `playbook::init::wire`, the module that writes
//! every hook Claude Code can invoke into `settings.json` as a bare
//! `playbook hook <name>` command, retiring `hooks/hooks.json`. Every entry
//! `wire` manages, hooks and guards alike, is upserted unconditionally. Only
//! a command that is exactly `playbook hook <name>` is ours: a user's own
//! script command is never rewritten.
//!
//! **Test isolation:** every test here operates on a fresh scratch directory
//! under the OS temp dir (`scratch_settings_path`), never on a real
//! `~/.claude/settings.json`. A test that wrote a developer's live settings
//! file would be a defect regardless of whether it passed.
//!
//! Coverage map:
//! - Idempotence (assert on file bytes, not a return value):
//!   `running_wire_twice_writes_nothing_the_second_time`
//! - Every written command for a ported hook resolves to a real `HookName`,
//!   and is a bare name rather than a path (the "bare-name assumption"),
//!   and all 24 ported hooks (the 18 functional hooks plus the 6 safety
//!   guards) are exactly the ones wired that way:
//!   `every_ported_hook_command_is_a_bare_playbook_hook_invocation_that_resolves`
//! - A pre-existing user hook entry survives wiring, unclobbered:
//!   `pre_existing_user_hook_entry_is_preserved_not_clobbered`
//! - Every guard gets its bare command, and a user's script command under
//!   `~/.claude/hooks/` stays:
//!   `every_guard_gets_its_bare_command_and_a_user_script_command_stays`
//! - The bare-name form survives a write-then-read round trip:
//!   `bare_name_form_survives_write_then_read_round_trip`
//! - Backup is timestamped and taken only when a change actually lands:
//!   `settings_json_is_backed_up_before_a_real_change_and_not_on_a_no_op`
//! - Regression pin for the defect itself: every hook name wired in binary
//!   form has a real (non-stub) Rust implementation behind it:
//!   `every_hook_wired_in_binary_form_has_a_non_stub_implementation`
//! - A user command named like a guard script (`<name>.sh`, `<name>.py`) is
//!   kept, and the bare form is added next to it:
//!   `a_user_command_named_like_a_guard_script_is_kept_and_the_bare_form_is_added`
