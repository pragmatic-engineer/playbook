//! Installer/repair modules for the local Claude Code configuration, backing
//! the `playbook setup` subcommand:
//!
//! - `merge` is the three-way settings merge (the retired shell original).
//! - `wire` writes the ported hook entries into `settings.json`, backing it up
//!   first.
//! - `path` puts the binary's directory on PATH for every shell start.
//! - `shim` installs the bash and zsh launcher shim idempotently.
//! - `attribution` sets the commit and PR attribution OFF (the default) or ON.
//! - `collector_service` removes the files of the retired collector service.
//! - `statusline` moves a legacy `statusLine.command` to `playbook statusline`.
//! - `system_prompt` places the opt-in `prompts/SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`.
//! - `memory_migrate`, `migrate` and `self_root` handle upgrades and the plugin root.
//! - `run` composes all five above into `Command::Init`'s dispatch arm.
//!
//! Three of those five place a file, and each places one that some other
//! component names: `settings.json`'s `statusLine.command` names the
//! statusline, and `commands/doctor.md`'s Layer 4 names the system prompt.
//! That is the rule
//! this module enforces, **the component that names a path is the component
//! that puts the file there**, learned twice the hard way (the 2026-08-12
//! statusline outage, and the 2026-08-11 hook-rename incident that produced
//! roughly 110 silent errors over 28 hours).
//!
//! `settings.shared.json` is in binary-invoked form. `wire` changes what a user's own `settings.json` looks like after
//! they choose to run `playbook setup`.
