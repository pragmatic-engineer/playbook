//! The collector's lifetime lock, and how starters find, start and stop it.
//!
//! The collector takes an exclusive lock on `collector.lock` before it binds
//! and keeps it until it exits. The OS drops the lock on any exit, so a held
//! lock always means a live collector and there is no stale state to clean up.
//! The holder writes `<pid> <version>\n` into the file through the locked
//! handle, because `collector.json` is written late in startup and keeps a
//! dead pid after a crash.
//!
//! Starters (`ensure`) check the lock with one open and one shared
//! `try_lock`. A free lock spawns a detached collector, throttled by the
//! respawn stamp `collector.spawned`. A holder from another version is asked
//! to stop and replaced. `stop` sends the authenticated shutdown request and,
//! when allowed, falls back to `SIGKILL` after checking the pid is really the
//! collector.
