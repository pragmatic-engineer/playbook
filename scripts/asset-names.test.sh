# asset-names.test.sh: the release asset names that cargo binstall and mise
# depend on must not change by accident.
#
# Usage: asset-names.test.sh
#
# `cargo binstall` builds the download URL from `[package.metadata.binstall]`
# in crates/cli/Cargo.toml, and `mise use github:pragmatic-engineer/playbook`
# picks an asset by the operating system and architecture words in its name.
# Both need the raw binary of each target at playbook-<version>-<target>[.exe]
# (ADR 0039). This test expands the binstall template for every target in the
# build matrix of release.yml and compares it with the name the workflow gives
# the asset. It also pins the two metadata lines that keep binstall on those
# assets and off the foreign crates.io crate.
