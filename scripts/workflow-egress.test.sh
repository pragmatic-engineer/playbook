# Usage: workflow-egress.test.sh
#
# A job with `egress-policy: block` that runs `gh attestation verify` must
# allow every host that command calls. Run 38880075330 failed when the
# publish job could not reach the storage that holds the attestation
# bundles. The check reads each workflow as text, one job at a time, and
# exits 1 with one line per missing host. It also runs itself on a fixture
# that lacks a host, so a broken check fails too.
