# aur-verify.sh: builds and checks the AUR package playbook-bin. The release
# runs it inside the archlinux:base-devel container, as root, because makepkg
# refuses root and pacman -U needs it. The script makes a user for makepkg.
#
#   aur-verify.sh srcinfo <dir>
#     Writes <dir>/.SRCINFO with `makepkg --printsrcinfo` of <dir>/PKGBUILD.
#   aur-verify.sh build <dir> <version>
#     Builds <dir>/PKGBUILD with `makepkg -f` (no -s: the package has no
#     dependencies, so no pacman mirror is used), installs it with pacman -U,
#     checks that `playbook --version` says <version>, that pacman owns
#     /usr/bin/playbook, and that <dir>/.SRCINFO, when there, is what
#     makepkg prints now. It then downloads the aarch64 asset and checks it
#     against the sum in the PKGBUILD. CARCH=aarch64 makepkg --verifysource is
#     not used, since makepkg.conf may override CARCH.
#   aur-verify.sh aarch64-asset <PKGBUILD>
#     Prints "<url> <sha256>" of the aarch64 source. Needs no container.
