# release-gh.sh: the GitHub steps of a release (ADR 0039), each safe to run
# again. GH_TOKEN must hold a token for <repo>; the release workflow passes
# the igorjs app token. Every step prints key=value lines on stdout.
#
#   release-gh.sh pr <repo> <branch> <title> <body-file> <dir> <file>...
#     Opens a pull request to the default branch of <repo> with one commit
#     that sets each <file> to its content under <dir>, and turns on
#     auto-merge. <dir> is a checkout of <repo>, and the commit starts from
#     its HEAD, which must still be the head of the default branch, so the
#     commit cannot undo a change that landed after the checkout. The commit
#     is made with createCommitOnBranch, so GitHub signs it. <branch> must be
#     release/vX.Y.Z, and each <file> a regular file inside <dir>. An open
#     pull request from <branch> in <repo> by the app is reused when its
#     files match <dir> (auto-merge is turned on again), and a merged one is
#     reported as merged. Any other open pull request on <branch> stops the
#     run. Prints pr=<number> and state=open|merged.
#
#   release-gh.sh wait <repo> <pr> <seconds>
#     Waits until the pull request merges, then prints sha=<merge commit>.
#     Fails when it closes without a merge or the time runs out. A failed
#     poll is retried.
#
#   release-gh.sh tag <repo> <tag> <sha>
#     Creates the lightweight tag <tag>, a vX.Y.Z, on <sha>. A tag that
#     already points at <sha>, an annotated one included, is fine, and one
#     that points elsewhere fails. When the create fails, the tag is read again, since
#     another run may have made it. Exits 3 when it is still missing, so the
#     caller can print the manual step.
#
#   release-gh.sh release <repo> <tag> <title> <notes-file>
#     Creates the published GitHub release for <tag> as the latest release,
#     unless a release for <tag> exists. For the downstream repositories,
#     whose release has no assets. Prints url=<release page>.
#
#   release-gh.sh state <repo> <tag>
#     Prints release=none, draft or published for the release of <tag>.
#     Only "release not found" means none. Any other error fails, so a
#     failed read is never taken for a missing release.
