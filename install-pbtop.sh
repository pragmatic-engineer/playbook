# Installer for pbtop alone, the standalone usage dashboard, on a machine
# without playbook. The README shows the curl command that pipes it to sh.
#
# It runs install.sh in its pbtop mode. That fetches
# pbtop-<version>-<target>.tar.gz from the latest release, or from the
# release named by PLAYBOOK_REF, checks its line in SHA256SUMS, its build
# attestation when gh can check it, and `pbtop --version`, then installs pbtop
# into PLAYBOOK_BIN_DIR (default $HOME/.local/bin) and puts that folder on
# PATH. Nothing else runs. Run from a checkout, it uses the install.sh next
# to it when that is playbook's and knows the pbtop mode, else the one on
# main. Homebrew has the same binary as the `pbtop`
# formula of pragmatic-engineer/tap.
